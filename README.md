    <th> <a href="https://omppu42.itch.io/drifty-rocket"> <b> Drifty Rocket</b></a> was my first game that I published. <br> You control a rocket that needs to fight the gravity <br> and reach the finish line. <br> The faster you finish, the better. You can collect stars, which get progressively more difficult. <br> </th>
