    <th> <a href="https://omppu42.itch.io/drifty-rocket"> <b> Drifty Rocket</b></a> was my first game that I published. <br> You control a rocket that needs to fight the gravity and reach the finish. <br> The faster you finish, the better. You can collect stars, which are progressively more difficult. <br> </th>

    <th> <a href="https://github.com/Omppu42/ParticleSimulation"> <b> Particle Simulation</b></a> is a pretty recent project. <br> This was my first ever C++ program, so it took quite a while. <br> It has the capacity to simulate nearly 10000 particles. <br> I used C++ and OpenGL for this. <br></th>
